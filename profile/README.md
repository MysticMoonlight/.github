## Announcement: Goodbye, Mystic Moonlight
Hey all,

I'm sad to announce that as of June 13 2023, Mystic Moonlight will be disbanded.
The team name began as 'Mystic Prism Studio', which has a goal to make several projects related to games, and grew up as community with a new name 'Mystic Moonlight'.
This community was founded by Roon, and everyone in the Mystic Moonlight community was treated as a team.

Unfortunately due to Roon's lack of motivation to maintain Mystic Moonlight Discord community due to unhelpful Discord team regarding of Server Raids/Attacks,
at the end the discord server was closed down, being Roon as only solo development team.

Recently I has been thinking about disbanding Mystic Moonlight and making myself to be more honest,
and this decision finally led to this announcement.

Now I wanted to be myself instead of using the other name.

The mas.to account, [@Mystic_Moonlight](https://mas.to/@Mystic_Moonlight) will be rebranded as 'Roon's Project Diary', which will act as announcement regarding of QuantuMiz, moonfig, and such.
The account name will remain as @Mystic_Moonlight to keep the history as-is.

All projects and repositories will be moved to [RoonMoonlight](https://codeberg.org/RoonMoonlight),
and project will be worked on by myself. (But as always anyone is welcome to contribute with pull request! If you are interested feel free to do so)

Thank you all, farewell Mystic Moonlight.
- Roon
